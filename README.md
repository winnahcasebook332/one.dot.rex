## Where does the “Re” come in?

After Hachidori stopped being maintained, I never found another LSPosed solution that really fit the way I use X. The `Re` is basically about picking up where this kind of module left off and starting fresh at the same time. Re:X is built from the ground up specifically for the refactored X Android interface.

It started simply because I couldn't stand that Premium users on iOS could customize their navigation bar while Android users still couldn't, so I added it myself. I'll probably keep adding things I personally want to change, and I want the module's own settings UI to feel pleasant too.

Re:X only targets the redesigned X interface introduced in 2026. The older pre-rewrite interface and legacy mode are not supported.

Re:X is adapted for specific X versions. After an X update, individual hooks may temporarily stop working when obfuscated structures change. Other versions use feature-based fallback matching where possible, but compatibility is not guaranteed.
